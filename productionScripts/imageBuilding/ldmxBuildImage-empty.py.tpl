# this is a placeholder file that is not supposed to do anything at all.
# when we run image generation jobs, no ldmx-sw template file is needed.
# only config file input is passed to the  image building script.
# the empty file is just here because the submission command checks for 
# an LDMX job template to even submit the job.
